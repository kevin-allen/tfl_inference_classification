# tfl_inference_classification

This provides code to perform inference using the TensorFlow Lite C++ API. 

It contains a AIInference class that you can use to perform inference using TF Lite models.

The code is based on some examples provided with the [TensorFlow source code](https://github.com/nxp-imx/tensorflow-imx/tree/lf-6.1.36_2.1.0/tensorflow/lite/examples/label_image). I took some inspiration from the label_image example.
